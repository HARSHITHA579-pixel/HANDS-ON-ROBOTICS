# Hands-On RoboVITics  

Welcome to the **Hands-On RoboVITics Workshop Repository!**  
In this event, you’ll learn how to **build and control your own bot from scratch** in just **2 days**.  

## Part 1: ESP32 Bot Setup  
Set up your ESP32-powered bot with motor driver control, ultrasonic distance measurement, Wi-Fi connectivity, and authentication.  

## Part 2: Web Development  
Build a login page and a control page using simple web development tools.  
This is where you’ll learn how to control your bot through a browser.  

## Part 3: Server & Control  
Turn your ESP32 into a live web server that manages logins, checks obstacles in real-time, and controls your bot’s movements directly from the browser.  

## What You’ll Need

- ESP32 board  
- The kit provided in the workshop  
- A web browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
